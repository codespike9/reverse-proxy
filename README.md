# Reverse Proxy in Go

A lightweight and customizable reverse proxy server built using Go's standard `net/http` package. This project demonstrates how to route incoming HTTP requests to backend services based on a simple YAML configuration.

## 🛠 Features

- Reverse proxy functionality
- Route-based request forwarding
- Easy-to-configure routing with `config.yaml`
- Logging to `proxy.log`
- Simple and efficient codebase

## 📁 Project Structure

```
reverse-proxy/
├── main.go             # Entry point for the reverse proxy server
├── config.yaml         # Configuration file defining routes
├── proxy.log           # Log file for incoming requests
└── reverse-proxy.exe   # Built executable (on Windows)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Routing behavior is controlled via the `config.yaml` file in the root directory.

### Example `config.yaml`

yaml
```
routes:
  - path_prefix: /api
    backend: http://localhost:3001
    server: localhost:3002
```

This example means:

- Requests starting with `/api/` will be proxied to `http://localhost:3001/` if request is like `localhost:3002/api`

Make sure your backend services are running and accessible at the target addresses.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or newer
- Internet connection to fetch dependencies (if any)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codespike9/reverse-proxy.git
cd reverse-proxy
```

2. **Build the project**

```bash
go build -o reverse-proxy.exe main.go
```

3. **Run the server**

```bash
./reverse-proxy.exe
```

Your proxy will start listening for incoming HTTP requests and route them based on the configuration.

## 📒 Logging

All request logs are saved to a file named `proxy.log` in the project directory. You can use this for monitoring or debugging routing behavior.

## 👥 Contributing
